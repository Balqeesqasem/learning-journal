# Version Control

It's a system allow to make changes on file, programing it ..etc.


# Local Version Control

It's locally in my machine not on the internet.


# Centralized Version Control

CVCS come for people who works on teams ,one server that save all changes and files.
all members on the team can access the system.
That's make Teamwork easier and more flexible to see and share what each member do.


# Distributed Version Control

Now what if the central database’s hard disk has a corruption ?

Corruption of central database’s hard disk all work will be lost if they dont have absence of backups!
So what we can do ?

DVCS come to solve this problem allows clients to create the same repositories.
These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.



# Git

Git is a DVCS made up of snapshots , we can store file on it , after each change we do we have to save it and that called committ.
Git  relies on local operations.
It has some feature like tracking changes and Loss of Data.
