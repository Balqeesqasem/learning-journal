# Mastering Markdown

### Markdown 

Markdown is away to stayle your page and make it look butter ,we can use some non-alphabetic characters like * , _ , # ..etc and we have a different syntax to write on it  .

We can make header , ordered and unordered lists , Image , links ...etc.



#GitHub Flavored Markdown


Its a special version of features only for Markdown which make it more easy and useful .
But we can't use all Flavored Markdown ; some of it just used in descriptions and comments as @mentions , SHA-1 hashes.

### Some example of GitHub Flavored Markdown
