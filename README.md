## Some information I learn about Markdown:

If you want to make aheading for your website you have to but a "#" before your header , you can make the head larger by increasing number of "#" , from 1 up to six Biggest to smallest.

We can *Styling* text by usin some sine like " ** "

If you wan't to add a link like that [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) you have to use aformat like in the link i attach before using  "[]" and (but link here).

Now if you have a list you can do it easily by just typing - or * before what you want to list .




Some of Markdown i use:

* Heading
* Link
* Styling
* list
